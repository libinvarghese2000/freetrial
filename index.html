    <h1>Shawarma Hut</h1>
    <p>“Food for us comes from our relatives, whether they have wings or fins or roots. That is how we consider food. Food has a culture. It has a history. 
        It has a story. It has relationships.”</p>

        <p>A classic shawarma is made on a massive spit, and roasted over a long time, soaking up its own juices. Yes, nothing beats this, but I opted for a quicker, easier method- bbq skewers. </p>
